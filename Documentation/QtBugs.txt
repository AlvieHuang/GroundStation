- Error: dependent (filename) does not exist
Solution: Your Makefile is not updated. You probably deleted something and your Makefile
still has it listed as a dependency for debug/release builds. Run qmake to update your Makefile,
and you should be good.

- Error: QApplication. No such file or directory.
Go to your .pro file. Make sure QT += widgets is there

- Error: Project not configured
Go to projects and click "configure project"
