Won't compile successfully on Qt 5.4.0 - Windows - MSVC. There are issues with a lot of Winapi and Networking
files. I'm currently just developing on 5.3.1, but this issue may need to be looked into more.

In MissionRecap constructor in missionrecap.cpp, when running QtTabTest, the tabs are
fine if you comment out "mediaPlayer.setVideoOutput...". If you leave it uncommented, it doesn't work.

The 'Exit' button simply causes a program crash.
