===============
Spring Quarter updates:

Github is now complete with .gitignore and all the excess files deleted.
If any of your changes got overwritten in the between quarter merge, let Nathan know Immediatly, as over the weekend of week 2, the old branches will be deleted and the new branching method will take place, and I dont want to have to dig through the backups of those old branches. 

Also, PUSH NIGHTLY, and have a designated member of your team to merge your branch on sunday night.
